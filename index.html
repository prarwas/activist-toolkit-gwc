        "The lack of resources is also one of the most prominent challenges. The [OHCHR] report indicates that despite the impact of mental health conditions on individuals, families and communities, there is inadequate investment of both financial and human resources to mental health. For an example, the global annual spending on mental health is reported to be less than $2 per person and less than $0.25 per person in low-income countries" -
